# Okta-UAM
Used Okta SDK to create, active, deactive user. Assign User to different group for role based authorization with claims transformation also implemented.
For login I used an angular application which will be found in : https://github.com/nayeemahmed24/Sample-Application-with-Ocelot-MassTransit-and-Okta-Auth

Note: It's just learning purpose so I didn't used authorization on all endpoints and super admin token.
